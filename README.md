## 🏦 Bank Credit & Debit Transactions Dashboard – SQL + Power BI

An interactive analytics dashboard designed using SQL and Power BI to explore and visualize banking transactions. 
This project focuses on credit and debit trends, customer behavior, and financial KPIs across multiple dimensions such as time, branch, and bank.


## 📌 Project Overview

This dashboard provides actionable insights into:
Transaction types (Credit vs Debit)
Transaction methods (Card, Bank Transfer, etc.)
Customer behavior across days, weeks, and months
Branch performance and bank-level volumes
Key financial ratios and activity metrics

🔧 Built with real-world logic to simulate a banking environment, this project is ideal for showcasing SQL + Power BI integration in financial analytics.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

📌 SQL – Data transformation, filtering, grouping, and KPI logic

📌 Power BI – Interactive dashboard creation, DAX measures, time-based slicing

📌 DAX – Custom calculated fields for Net Amount, Ratios, Growth Metrics

📌 Excel/CSV – Source data storage and schema mapping

##  🔍 Key Insights

💡 Transaction volume is consistent across methods (~33% each).

💡 Credit slightly exceeds debit transactions (Credit-to-Debit Ratio: 100.25%).

💡 Most active transaction days: Monday and Sunday.

💡 Branches like City Center and Downtown show highest growth.

💡 December saw a steep drop in transactions (possibly seasonal or system-related).

💡 Specific banks (e.g., Kotak, Axis) lead in total volume.

##  📤 How to Run This Project

📌 Load the dataset into your SQL environment and execute transformation queries.

📌 Use the SQL output or views to connect with Power BI.

📌 Open the .pbix file and ensure the data connection is active.

📌 Refresh visuals and interact using slicers for Day, Week, Month, Branch, Method, etc.
