🏦 Bank Credit & Debit Transactions Dashboard – SQL + Power BI

An interactive analytics dashboard designed using SQL and Power BI to explore and visualize banking transactions. This project focuses on credit and debit trends, customer behavior, and financial KPIs across multiple dimensions such as time, branch, and bank.

📌 Project Overview

This dashboard provides actionable insights into:
Transaction types (Credit vs Debit)
Transaction methods (Card, Bank Transfer, etc.)
Customer behavior across days, weeks, and months
Branch performance and bank-level volumes
Key financial ratios and activity metrics

🔧 Built with real-world logic to simulate a banking environment, this project is ideal for showcasing SQL + Power BI integration in financial analytics.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

SQL – Data transformation, filtering, grouping, and KPI logic
Power BI – Interactive dashboard creation, DAX measures, time-based slicing
DAX – Custom calculated fields for Net Amount, Ratios, Growth Metrics
Excel/CSV – Source data storage and schema mapping
